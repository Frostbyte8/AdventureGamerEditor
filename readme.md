Adventure Gamer Editor++ is a map editor for Adventure Gamer for Windows.

With this editor, you can edit world's larger than 10x10 cells, and many restrictions from the original editor have been lifted where possible.

This editor is a work in progress, so it may crash and be a bit rough in places.

If you want to play your worlds, you will need a copy of Adventure Gamer For Windows. You can run the game in a Virtual Machine or using OTVDM.
