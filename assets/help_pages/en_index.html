    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="main.png" /></div>

    <p>This is the main editor. On the left is the road selector palette, it contains all 32 road types. There is no need to switch between grass and dirt tiles anymore.</p>
    <p>The center pane is the actual map. You can draw tiles here by double clicking, or pressing space. You can also move the selection box around with the arrow keys. Right click will open the tile submenu on the currently selected tile.</p> 
    <p>The bottom pane contains information about what objects and characters are on the currently selected tile.</p>
    <p>Finally, the right most side contains the list of objects and characters that can placed and edited, as well as buttons to add and delete characters.</p>
    <p>You can edit the world's summary and story from the &quot;World&quot; menu, as well as the player's attributes, the name of the world, and the name of the currency.</p>
    <p>If you find the map too small you can zoom in with the zoom menu, up to 4 times the original size.</p>
